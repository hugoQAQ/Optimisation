# Optimisation
Final project for Optimisation course

## Quick preview

- Authors:Weicheng HE, Aymane OUIJALI, Pierre-Alexandre SIMON
- Context: For Optimisation course of Master in Big Data & Data Science at Mines Nancy, we did a project in group to solve the optimisation problem by mathematical simulation.
- Topic: circle-packing and sphere-packing
- Methods: Global Optimisation algorithms implemented by solver *Pyomo* 
  - Multistart
  - MBH
- Programming: Python
- Result: very close performance to benchmark on [packomania][http://www.packomania.com]

## Circle-packing and Sphere-packing

In geometry, **circle packing** is the study of the arrangement of circles (of equal or varying sizes) on a given surface such that no overlapping occurs and so that no circle can be enlarged without creating an overlap. The associated packing density, *η*, of an arrangement is the proportion of the surface covered by the circles. Generalisations can be made to higher dimensions – this is called **sphere packing**, which usually deals only with identical spheres.
